The clustering algorithms implemented are tested with various test data that are attached.
Out of all the test samples, few of them like iris.csv, seeds.csv, libra.csv, Frogs_MFCCs.csv gave the best results.

The best test results are shown in the Presentation and the others are used to analyse the time complexity of linkage algorithms vs k means. The results are plotted accordingly.
